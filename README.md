# 🎮 Video Game Sales EDA Project

This project is part of my internship **Task-02** at #ProdigyInfoTech. The goal was to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset.

I selected the **Video Game Sales** dataset from Kaggle, which includes sales figures, platforms, genres, ratings, and critic/user review scores for thousands of games released over multiple decades.
